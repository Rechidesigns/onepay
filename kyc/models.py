    A KYC or Know Your Customer is used to gather information on user in a regular interval.
    The KYCs collect information such as where they live, collecting their updated or different ID
    information, and their risk level at that point in time.

    Know Your Client (KYC) is a requirement that protects both financial institutions and their users. Financial institutions are required to formally verify the identity of all users and understand the purpose of trading, expected volumes and jurisdictions their users will use.

    Identity verification is a requirement for companies across a range of industries. Veriff offers compliance, fraud prevention and global scalability.
